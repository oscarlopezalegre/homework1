## Notes

I miss the first lesson, therefore his was really difficult for me... the code is horrible-crappy-disgusting and goes on, it can be used as an example of how to not code. 
For this reason I'm asking for the first lesson video.

Heroku make me suffer, assets didn't compile without this options:
    config.serve_static_assets = true
    config.assets.compile = true
